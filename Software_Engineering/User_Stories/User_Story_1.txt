Story:
As a player I want to 'know I have alerted a NPC enemy' so that I can 'avoid detection and not lose the game'

Acceptance Criteria:
NPC enemy's Vision Cone is visually displayed in the game space clearly.
NPC enemy's Vision Cone's colour changes from green to red.
When detected a sound cue plays to inform the player.
When detected both the player's sprite and NPC enemy's sprite changes to reflect it.
After detection the game is set to a 'Lose' state.
